# RPG - Dragon Repeller (Повелителят на драконите)
Tiny Role Playing Game created upon the ***freeCodeCamp tutorial***  
[**"JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures"**](  
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8)
***
The game has minor updates, like additional functions and buttons and I changed the text to Bulgarian, so my son can play.
